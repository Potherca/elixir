# Elixir

## Introduction

After a discussion with [Arjan Kleene], we decided that it would be fun to see
what the [Elixir] programming languages is like.

## First steps in Elixir

- Installed [an Elixir plugin for my IDE](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir).
- Looked up [Elixir on Wikipedia] to get some background (like the fact that the 
  language started in 2012).
- [Installed Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html), `brew install elixir` 
  for OSX or `sudo apt-get install elixir` on Debian/Ubuntu
  Of course, as Elixir is build on top of the Erlang VM, one of the dependencies 
  was Erlang which took some time to download and install, being 7460 files and 286MB.
- `elixir -v` -> Elixir 1.0.5
- Wrote a ['hello world'](hello-world.exs).
- Looked up [`IO.puts` in the manual](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/).
- Read about [Basic types in the Elixir manual].
- Tried making a more complex "hello world".
- Learned an interesting lesson about variables, atoms and string interpolation.

That (and reading through the manual for a bit) was a fun introduction into the 
language. Easy to install, easy to understand and fun to use, I can understand 
why some people are [betting on Elixir].
