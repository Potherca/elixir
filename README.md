#Elixir

## Introduction

After a discussion with [Arjan Kleene] we decided that it would be fun to see
what the [Elixir] programming languages is like. This is what happened.

## Step taken

- Installed [an Elixir plugin for my IDE](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir).
- Looked up [Elixir on Wikipedia] to get some background (like the fact that the language started in 2012).
- [Installed Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html), `brew install elixir` for OSX or `sudo apt-get install elixir` on Debian/Ubuntu
  Ofcourse, as Elixir is build on top of the Erlang VM, one of the dependencies was Erlang which took
  some time to download and install, being 7460 files and 286MB.
- `elixir -v` -> Elixir 1.0.5
- Wrote a 'hello world'
